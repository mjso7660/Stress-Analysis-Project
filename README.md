## Finding stress tensor using superposition

### Principle of superposition
Consider a solid body with certain geometry, made of certain materials and supported by certain displacement boundary conditions. This body is being analyzed by the 15 linear governing equations of linear theory of elasticity. The body is subjected to multiple external loading over -a≤y≤a.
	According to the principle of superposition, if multiple loadings σ_x^1,〖 σ〗_x^2,σ_x^3,… act on the body simultaneously, then solution is [σ_x^1+σ_x^2+σ_x^3+⋯]
